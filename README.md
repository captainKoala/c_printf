# c_printf
It's my short version of printf function in C language. I made it due to the need for programming experience. 

Here is ft_printf function, which behave like standard printf function with d-, i-, u-, x-, X-, c-, s-, p- %- conversions. It manage flags '-', '0', '*', '.', '+', ' ', '#'.
According to the task, I couldn't use any functions except to malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end.

Makefile creates library with ft_printf-function.
